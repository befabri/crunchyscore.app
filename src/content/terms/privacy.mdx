## Information Collection, Use, and Sharing

- **Personal Data:** The Extension collects information from users in the form of unique identifiers ("id"). These identifiers correspond to the Crunchyroll IDs of anime on the user's page. When a user interacts with the Extension, these identifiers are sent to the Extension's API. The collected identifiers are used for providing and improving the functionality of the Extension, specifically for actions related to the user's Crunchyroll anime page.

- **Non-personal Data:** When you interact with our Extension and API, we automatically receive and store certain types of non-personal information such as HTTP method, request URL, status code, response time, user-agent, and client IP address.
